QUOTE EXTRACTION RULES:
- Use exact quotes from the text when possible
- If paraphrasing is needed, preserve the meaning
- Quotes should be complete sentences

NORMALIZATION RULES (Fix OCR/PDF artifacts):
1. FIX SPACED-OUT TEXT: "lea der ship" → "leadership"
2. FIX NAME SPACING: "Jo hn Smith" → "John Smith"
3. PRESERVE LEGITIMATE SPACES: "New York" stays "New York"
