PDF and image text extraction often produces spacing artifacts. You MUST fix these:

1. FIX SPACED-OUT WORDS: Remove spurious spaces within words
   - "Co lumb ia" -> "Columbia"
   - "Uni ver sity" -> "University"
   - "Bache lor" -> "Bachelor"

2. FIX SPACED-OUT DATES: Remove spaces within dates
   - "201 4" -> "2014"
   - "Sep tem ber" -> "September"

3. FIX SPACED-OUT NUMBERS: Remove spaces within numbers
   - "3. 8" -> "3.8"
   - "$ 50,0 00" -> "$50,000"

4. PRESERVE LEGITIMATE SPACES: Keep spaces between actual words
   - "New York" stays "New York"
   - "John Smith" stays "John Smith"

5. FIX CHARACTER SUBSTITUTIONS: Correct common OCR errors
   - "0" (zero) that should be "O" (letter) based on context
   - "l" (lowercase L) that should be "I" (uppercase i) based on context
