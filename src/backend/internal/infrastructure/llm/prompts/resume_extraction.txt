Extract structured profile data from the following resume text.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Use null for missing optional fields (do NOT use empty strings or placeholder values)
- For current jobs, set isCurrent to true and use null for endDate
- GPA must be a numeric value like "3.8" or "3.8/4.0" - NEVER put a date in the GPA field
- Each field must contain the correct type of data - do not mix up fields
- Skills should be a flat array of individual skill names

DATE EXTRACTION RULES (CRITICAL):
- ALL dates MUST be in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., "2020-01-15")
- The YEAR is REQUIRED. If you cannot determine the year, return null for that date field
- Expanding partial dates:
  - Month + Year (e.g., "Sep 2018") → "2018-09-01" (use 1st of month)
  - Year only (e.g., "2020") → "2020-01-01" (use January 1st)
  - Month only without year (e.g., "September") → null (year is required)
- If a date cannot be parsed or is ambiguous, return null
- NEVER return malformed dates like "-09-01" or "0000-09-01"
- Common patterns: "Present", "Current", "Now" for endDate means isCurrent=true and endDate=null
