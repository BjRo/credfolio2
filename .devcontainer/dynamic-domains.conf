# Dynamic domains configuration for dnsmasq ipset integration
# These domains have IPs that change frequently and need dynamic resolution.
#
# Format: one domain per line
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Empty lines are ignored
#
# When DNS queries for these domains are made, dnsmasq will automatically
# add the resolved IPs to the 'allowed-domains' ipset, allowing firewall
# rules to permit traffic to those IPs.
