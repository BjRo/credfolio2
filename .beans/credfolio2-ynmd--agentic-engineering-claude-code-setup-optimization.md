Optimize our Claude Code agentic engineering setup across three themes:

## Themes

### 1. Context Management
Make good use of the agent context — avoid overloading it with too much information, find things quickly, and use subagents where appropriate.

### 2. Dev Workflow Reliability
Make the whole dev-workflow very reliable using hooks, skills, and other Claude Code features to enforce rules deterministically rather than relying on instructions alone.

### 3. Devcontainer Reliability
Ensure the devcontainer setup works as expected — tools are available, services are healthy, and rebuilds are predictable.
