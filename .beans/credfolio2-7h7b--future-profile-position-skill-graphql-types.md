Expand GraphQL schema with Profile, Position, and Skill types.

## Context
The initial GraphQL API focuses on User, File, and ReferenceLetter to support the "First Vertical Slice" milestone. This task captures the future work to add richer profile-related types.

## Scope (future)
- Define Profile type (extended user information)
- Define Position type (job positions/experience)
- Define Skill type (extracted skills from reference letters)
- Add queries for profile data
- Add mutations for profile management

## Notes
- This is a placeholder to not lose track of the original epic scope
- Will need domain model expansion before implementation
- May be part of a future milestone focused on profile building
