The LLM-based education extraction from uploaded resumes continuously produces incorrect or malformed results. The extraction pipeline fails to correctly parse education entries (degree, institution, dates, GPA) from resume PDFs. Related to credfolio2-6ns6 (malformed education data), but this tracks the broader pattern of extraction unreliability.
