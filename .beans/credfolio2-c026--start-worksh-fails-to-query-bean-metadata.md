## Problem

When running `.claude/scripts/start-work.sh credfolio2-o624`, the script fails at step 2/5 with:

```
[0;31mError: Bean 'credfolio2-o624' not found[0m
```

The bean exists and can be queried directly via `beans query`, so the issue is in how the script queries bean metadata.

## Likely Cause

The script may be using an incorrect GraphQL query path (e.g., `.data.bean.type` instead of `.bean.type`) or passing the bean ID in an unexpected format to the `beans query` command.

The bean body for credfolio2-o624 mentions: "The `beans query --json` output uses `.bean.type` (not `.data.bean.type`) — the existing `start-work.sh` script has a bug here; don't replicate it"

## Steps to Reproduce

```bash
.claude/scripts/start-work.sh credfolio2-o624
```

## Expected

Script should query the bean successfully and create a feature branch.

## Actual

Script errors with "Bean 'credfolio2-o624' not found" at step 2/5.
