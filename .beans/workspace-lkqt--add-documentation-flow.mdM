Goal: We want to continously maintain documentation for this project.

This is meant for agents so that they can quickly find the most important technical and process decisions. But it's also intended to be read by humands to quickly understand the project.

I want to setup our claude code based environment so that whenever

1. we modify the tech stack
2. introduce new concepts into the codebase or deprecate old ones

we document this into codebase.

It should be clear to claude code that it has to do this (maybe use a skill?).

The documentation shoud live inside the code repository at the root folder in a directory called 'decisions' which consists of timestamped markdown files, similar to how Ruby on Rails names their database migrations. Each decision goes into a separate file.

The documentation needs to contain at minimum

1. Title (what was done?)
2. Reasoning (why it was done?)
3. Bean id: (id of the bean that introduced it)
